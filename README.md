# Workshop-2

This repository contains a simple multi-page static website where I practised adding different links and photos to web pages.

> GitHub: https://github.com/Burdulaa/Workshop-2

## What this project demonstrates

- Creating multiple HTML pages and linking between them with navigation links:
  - `index.html`
  - `about.html`
  - `contacts.html`
  - `hobbies.html`
- Using images stored in an `Images/` folder with relative paths.
- Styling pages with a shared stylesheet `style.css`. 
- Basic HTML/CSS layout, no JavaScript and no backend.

## Tech stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Runs entirely in the browser (no build tools required)

## Getting started

You only need a browser.
